# TAP REWARDS 

Coding for Product - LA Metro Project
<br><br>
Project Purpose:
We are creating a reward app to help promote metro use.  To make our app user-friendly (not burdensome/task intensive) we are utilizing TAPcard data to automate a point / reward system (ridership = points) for the user.  They just need to sign-up and link their Tapcard data to our app. Our app then it calculates points and offers rewards in accordance with ridership (more points = better rewards).  All our rewards are metro/travel based which further incentivizes future use of the metro (e.g. X points=free metro day pass or X points=free parking at a metro station, etc.,)
